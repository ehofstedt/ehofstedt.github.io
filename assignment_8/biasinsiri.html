    <div class="row"><h2>Project Summary</h2></div><br>
    <div class="row"><h3>The Problem</h3></div>
    <div class="row"><p>Siri is unreliable for users whose primary language is not English. While some have developed work-around solutions to use Siri, many are deterred by the present challenges and choose not to use it at all.</p></div><br>
    <div class="row"><h3>The Solution</h3></div>
    <div class="row">
        <p>Our solution allows Siri to <b>learn from its users</b> so that it may better recognize voices, accents, commands, and habits.</p>
        <p>It also allows Siri to <b>recover from errors</b> with minimal user input. The user may correct Siri but they would not need to have further dialogue about the error or send in a report.</p>

            <div class="row"><h4>Contextual Inquiry</h4></div>
            <div class="row">
            <p>After conducting background and generative research, our team conducted contextual inquiries with 4 users. All of these users had experience using Siri, and spoke English as a non-native language. We observed them completing tasks via Siri and learned about their experiences with voice assistants.</p></div>

            <div class="row"><h4>Storyboarding</h4></div>
            <div class="row">
            <p>Based on our contextual inquiries, our team conducted a rapid ideation exercise (Crazy 8's), after which we developed storyboards which detailed the user needs we uncovered. The storyboard ideas ranged from 'Safe' to 'Risky' and we tested our ideas with users during Speed Dating sessions. This research validated many of our hypotheses (see Insights below) and also uncovered latent needs.</p></div>

            <div class="row"><h4>Empathy Mapping</h4></div>
            <div class="row">
            <p>We interviewed several users and generated a representative Empathy Map for a non-native English speaker who wants to use Siri, but has been deterred from use based on its inability to respond correctly to their commands.</p><p>Users struggle with Siri's inability to understand them, and also see that voice assistants are becoming more ubiquitous and could be a valuable tool that is currently unavailable to them.</p><p>If they do use Siri, they only use it for low-risk tasks, because they do not trust it to work reliably.</p></div>

            <div class="row"><h4>Affinity Diagramming</h4></div>
            <div class="row">
            <p>Through affinity diagramming, our team discovered many themes across our users. We found that many users preferred other inputs to Siri, or if they did use Siri, it was only for specific tasks. User who did leverage Siri for sending messages found the transcription to be robotic and unnatural, which they found disappointing.</p><p>We also asked users about how they report technology issues they face, and many did not report issues because they did not trust that their reported problems would be resolved.</p></div>

    <div class="row"><h3>User Feedback</h3></div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col quote">“When using Siri and it doesn’t work, it’s the same sensation as when you talk to a person who doesn’t respond; it’s like they’re zoned out and they can’t react to you, like a teenager playing video games ignoring you.”</div>
        <div class="col quote">"Since my native language is not English, it makes it a little bit more prone to error. I don’t know, maybe someone whose first language is English, maybe they would be more inclined to use Siri for these more serious or direct tasks that need to be done."</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col quote">"I’m going to call my brother. But here’s the interesting thing. I usually have to make an American or English accent of that name for Siri to recognize it [...] I have to do it otherwise it won’t work."</div>
        <div class="col quote">“Hey, Siri, call Tung." [Siri takes a while to load...] "It says one second...oh wait! No!...It called a makeup artist in my phone instead of my boyfriend.”</div>

    <br>
    <div class="row"><h3>Insights</h3></div>
    <br>
    <div class="insightGrid">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <p class="insight">Users are reluctant to use Siri because they don’t trust that it will respond correctly to requests. Not receiving the correct response from Siri leads to a negative experience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col insightGridSquare">
                <p> When users do not receive a correct response from Siri or if it misunderstands them, they are left with the feeling of not being heard. This also happens when a user reports an issue or bias and does not receive a response. It's important for users to receive some sort of confirmation or acknowledgment.
                </p>
                <p>All participants liked the idea of Siri learning from their commands to improve ; this aligned with their need for Siri to accurately and reliably understand their commands. However they wanted this training to be done in the background without additional effort from the user.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col"><p class="insight">Users will report bias or other technical issues if they are prompted, but will not take an extra step to provide that feedback.</p></div>
            <div class="col insightGridSquare"><p>Users found it easy to respond to 'Yes-or-No' prompts when reporting technical issues. but didn't feel the need to report issues outside of this context.</p>
            <p>Users don't need the extra step of confirming that Siri should update its comprehension; they prefer for it to learn in the background and update automatically.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col"><p class="insight">Users are interested in using Siri for needs beyond direct commands, but don't want Siri to provide directives outside of its capabilities, such as medical advice. </p></div>
            <div class="col insightGridSquare"><p >For example, if Siri were to recognize a user's cough and provide medical advice, users are more likely to listen to soft non-intrusive advice (like wearing warmer clothes in cold weather) versus stronger diagnoses (like going to the doctor or taking a specific medication.</p>
            <p>While we uncovered a latent need in our users for Siri to provide additional support beyond responding directly to commands (like analyzing a cough, for example) they all mentioned that they would need to allow Siri to do this. They found it invasive if Siri were to perform this functionality on its own without permission.</p></div>

        <div class="col">
            <p>Our solution includes two approaches to improving Siri's interaction with multilingual users.</p>
            <p>First, we would want to allow Siri to <b>learn from its users</b> so that it may better recognize voices, accents, commands, and habits.</p>
            <p>Second, we would want Siri to <b>adjust from errors</b> with minimal user input. The user may correct Siri but they would not need to have further dialogue about the error or send in a report.</p>
            <p><b>Learnings</b></p>
            <p>This project was an exercise in moving quickly through several research stages in a short amount of time. We learned about the next stage in the assignment and I was interviewing a user less than 12 hours later. I learned to quickly develop interview protocols, ideate new concepts and sketch them for rapid user feedback, and generate insights through affinity diagramming to share with the larger group. </p><p>I plan to leverage my skills in rapid generative and evaluative research in many projects in the future.</p>
